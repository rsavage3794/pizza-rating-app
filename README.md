# Pizza Review App

## Objective
The Pizza Review App allows you to log some of the best (and possibly worst) pizza you come across in your everyday life. This app logs the name of the establishment, the city and state it's located in, as well as your own personal rating

## Stretch Goals

- I would want to link another pizza review app to mine so we can merge all data together

## User Stories

- I want the user to be able to add their new reviews to the database
- I want the user to be able to edit their reviews if they think it needs to be adjusted
- I want the user to be able to view their reviews individually if they'd like to
- I want the user to be able to delete their reviews
